title: About me
subtitle: I'm a full-stack web developer working remotely

remote:
  <p>I'm a tech enthusiast based in Madrid (Spain), working <a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/?s=remote">remotely</a> since 2014. It started just as a perk of my situation back then, but it quickly became my preferred way of working. I consider myself an eager learner and very self directed, and remote work empowers me to be more productive. I believe in it not just as a matter of "where", but a matter of "<a href="https://doist.com/blog/asynchronous-communication/">how</a>".</p>

profile:
  <p>I've been using <a href="https://www.rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails</a> since I knew of its existence in 2009. Rails and its ecosystem are always my default stack to develop anything and I usually add some spices like <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/">Docker</a>, <a a href="https://reactjs.org">React</a> or <a href="https://aws.amazon.com">AWS</a>. I always try and solve problems with the best suited tool, and learning how to use a new one is one of the most fun parts of my job.</p>
  <p>I've helped to grow products and teams in very different positions. I worked as a freelance, formed part of a team, led one and co-founded my own company.</a>
  <p>I like to follow methodologies such as <a href="https://www.scrum.org">Scrum</a>, working in <a href="https://management30.com">3.0 enviroments</a> and having the opportunity to decide and make a big impact in every project I touch.</p>
