# Daer

My personal web, just to show who I am. :)

Execute "make install", then "make start" an go to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)!

Executing "make deploy" will build the web and upload it to a branch named "gh-pages". It'll activate the project page for this repo.

## pushState disclaimer

I use "pushState" in "pages/index.js" to clear the URL because of the explained here:
[https://github.com/daerd/daerd.github.io/blob/master/README.md](https://github.com/daerd/daerd.github.io/blob/master/README.md)

If you want to use some of this code with another use case, please remove it.
